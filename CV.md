# CV

My interests are splitted between mathematics/data science and network and service monitoring. In my short but intense experience in the IT industry, I have observed many opportunities to improve the actual modeling procedures, integrating brand new techniques such as functional data analysis and neural networks to provide better metrics and characterizations to go further than the usual baseline.
