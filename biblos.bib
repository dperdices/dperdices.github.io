  abstract = {Realistic network traffic generation is essential for evaluating the performance, security, and scalability of modern communication systems. Traditional methods, such as traffic replay systems and statistical models, while useful, often fall short in capturing the complexity and variability of real-world network scenarios. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have introduced new approaches to synthetic traffic generation. This paper presents a novel architecture using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate synthetic network traffic, with a focus on creating multi-protocol conversations that are indistinguishable from real-world interactions. Through fine-tuning and prompt engineering, the proposed system successfully generates packet- and conversation-level network traffic for ICMP, ARP, DNS, TCP and HTTP protocols. Additionally, by integrating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, this model simulates real-world network conversations with high accuracy, being able to generate a conversation combining ARP, DNS, TCP and HTTP without packet or protocol errors. The results show how the application of LLMs in network traffic generation improves realism and adaptability, establishing this approach as a valuable tool for future security testing and network performance evaluation. In addition, the proposed methodology is easily adaptable to other LLMs available both through APIs and to be downloaded and executed on your own computer.},

  abstract = {Companies’ Network Operations Centers continuously monitor network health to keep activity fully operational in the current scenario of decentralization of digital workplaces. In this task, network managers have a diverse set of tools to proactively troubleshoot network changes that could potentially lead to network outages. Unfortunately, these tools primarily focus on servers and high-volume services, while changes in end-users’ traffic can also be a symptom of relevant issues such as the misuse and misconfiguration of resources, service slowdowns, and cybersecurity breaches. End-user behavior, in particular, tends to be more erratic and chaotic than server traffic, especially when different users may share the same IP address over time (e.g., DHCP and Wi-Fi environments). To address these challenges, we propose modeling end-user behavior as an unordered collection of activities (i.e., pieces of regular behavior) rather than as time series. These activities, such as downloading a file or browsing the Internet, yield an identifiable sequence of measurements in terms of network metrics over time (e.g., throughput or number of connections). Deviations from typical sequences of measurements are flagged as irregular behaviors, with higher priority assigned to increasingly uncommon patterns. This methodology leverages Markov chains to represent activities as sequences of expert-aware discrete states of network metrics. When applied to a multi-year dataset from a global enterprise, our proposal has been able to cope with the chaotic and challenging environment of end-user behavioral modeling, identifying critical issues such as DNS misconfigurations, compromised printers, and cybersecurity threats.}

These apps exploit encryption to gain free Internet access, known as free-riding, which complicates detection. To combat this, network traffic classification techniques are employed to identify illegitimate traffic patterns, using Machine Learning algorithms. This paper employs heuristic methods to uncover such patterns and trains supervised algorithms such as Support Vector Machine for entropy-based free-riding detection. By analyzing characteristics from simulated zero-rating use, deeper insights into traffic generation and identification are obtained.}},

For SatCom operators, it is thus fundamental to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of subscribers, to measure their satisfaction, spot anomalies and optimize the peculiar network setup. The Web has become the primary source of Internet content, and Web browsing is the main activity of internauts. This paper addresses the challenge of monitoring Web QoE in SatCom environments, proposing a tailored system that employs a supervised approach to predict Web QoE using passive measurements. The system collects training data through Test Agents that mimic real subscribers' traffic patterns and uses them to build Machine Learning (ML) models that predict performance metrics. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring Web QoE in SatCom environments, with limitations on website applicability and temporal stability. The need for periodic data generation and the development of a general machine learning model for unseen websites remain open challenges. This research contributes to enhancing web browsing experiences in SatCom and expanding understanding of Web QoE monitoring in diverse network settings.}},

We found that these metrics distribution is akin to the Gamma distribution with positive bias, and they vary influenced by geographical location, time, and day of the week. Finally, the popularity of these websites has been compared to their performance, showing that some actors consistently deliver the best quality while others fall behind, despite their relevance in the rankings.}},

Although this analysis might be seen as an easy task, different problems, such as encryption, the tangled web, with several domains visited at the same time in a single web page, or IP addresses of a cloud provider shared by several sites, make it a though job. However, despite these issues, users' privacy is still unaccomplished, as we show in this work. We provide a novel approach that only takes into account the IP addresses that the user has connected to without performing any reverse DNS lookup. We use this sequence of addresses as an input of a neural network, which is able to identify accurately which was the website actually visited among Alexa's World Top 500 most visited domains. Moreover, we have also studied other factors, such as the dependence on the DNS server used to resolve the visited IP addresses, the accuracy for the top domains (e.g., Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc.), data augmentation to improve our results, or the impact on packet sampling. In this last case, we conclude that, using only a 10\% of the packets, we can identify the visited website with an accuracy of 93\%, whereas it can be over 97\% if there is no packet sampling and we use data augmentation.}},

  abstract    = {In network management, it is important to model baselines, trends, and regular behaviors to adequately deliver network services. However, their characterization is complex, so network operation and system alarming become a challenge. Several problems exist: Gaussian assumptions cannot be made, time series have different trends, and it is difficult to reduce their dimensionality. To overcome this situation, we propose Deep-FDA, a novel approach for network service modeling that combines functional data analysis (FDA) and neural networks. Specifically, we explore the use of functional clustering and functional depth measurements to characterize network services with time series generated from enriched flow records, showing how this method can detect different separated trends. Moreover, we augment this statistical approach with the use of autoencoder neural networks, improving the classification results. To evaluate and check the applicability of our proposal, we performed experiments with synthetic and real-world data, where we show graphically and numerically the performance of our method compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives. We also exemplify its application in different network management use cases. The results show that FDA and neural networks are complementary, as they can help each other to improve the drawbacks that both analysis methods have when are applied separately.},

  abstract    = {Many management actions for networking infrastructures require to simultaneously consider the state of several network elements. This is particularly critical in the case of reconfigurable deployments, such as Virtual or Software-Defined Networks, to scale the affected equipment up and prevent performance bottlenecks. In this light, we present dPRISMA (distributed Passive Retrieval of Information, and Statistical Multipoint Analysis), a passive monitoring system intended to fit statistical models for network measurements and raise alarms in the case of extreme behaviors. As distinguishing features, dPRISMA relies on cost-effective multi-point network measurements, and is able to select a suitable parametric model optimizing the trade-off between fitting and complexity. Therefore, it can (i) correlate records collected from several vantage points and detect where performance issues are most likely to appear; (ii) adjust alarms in terms of the probability of events; and (iii) adapt its behavior to dynamic network conditions while presenting a fair identification of anomalous situations. We evaluate dPRISMA with experiments both in virtual environments and with real-world data to provide evidences of its applicability.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the demand of Over-The-Top (OTT) services such as multimedia streaming, web services or social networking is rapidly increasing. Consequently, there is a wide interest in studying the quality of these services so that Internet Service Providers (ISP) can deliver the best experience to their clients.For this purpose, we present FlexiTop, a flexible and scalable system to actively monitor these OTT services, which allows an operator to obtain metrics with a limited resource usage. Due to the continuous evolution of OTT services, this system was designed with different approaches that can be extrapolated to future situations.By looking at the results, the proposal meets all the expectations and requirements and therefore it proves its success. The proposed design was implemented and validated with different alternatives whenever it was possible, both in wired and wireless networks. Moreover, long-time testing was performed to both ensure its stability and analyze the obtained data.},
