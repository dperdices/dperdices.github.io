  abstract  = {Satellite Communication (SatCom) offers internet connectivity where traditional infrastructures are too expensive to deploy. When using satellites in a geostationary orbit, the distance from Earth forces a round trip time higher than 550 ms. Coupled with the limited and shared capacity of the physical link, this poses a challenge to the traditional internet access quality we are used to.In this paper, we present the first passive characterization of the traffic carried by an operational SatCom network. With this unique vantage point, we observe the performance of the SatCom technology, as well as the usage habits of subscribers in different countries in Europe and Africa. We highlight the implications of such technology on Internet usage and functioning, and we pin-point technical challenges due to the CDN and DNS resolution issues, while discussing possible optimizations that the ISP could implement to improve the service offered to SatCom subscribers.},

  abstract    = {In network management, it is important to model baselines, trends, and regular behaviors to adequately deliver network services. However, their characterization is complex, so network operation and system alarming become a challenge. Several problems exist: Gaussian assumptions cannot be made, time series have different trends, and it is difficult to reduce their dimensionality. To overcome this situation, we propose Deep-FDA, a novel approach for network service modeling that combines functional data analysis (FDA) and neural networks. Specifically, we explore the use of functional clustering and functional depth measurements to characterize network services with time series generated from enriched flow records, showing how this method can detect different separated trends. Moreover, we augment this statistical approach with the use of autoencoder neural networks, improving the classification results. To evaluate and check the applicability of our proposal, we performed experiments with synthetic and real-world data, where we show graphically and numerically the performance of our method compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives. We also exemplify its application in different network management use cases. The results show that FDA and neural networks are complementary, as they can help each other to improve the drawbacks that both analysis methods have when are applied separately.},

Due to the continuous evolution of OTT services, this system was designed with different approaches that can be extrapolated to future situations.By looking at the results, the proposal meets all the expectations and requirements and therefore it proves its success. The proposed design was implemented and validated with different alternatives whenever it was possible, both in wired and wireless networks. Moreover, long-time testing was performed to both ensure its stability and analyze the obtained data.},
